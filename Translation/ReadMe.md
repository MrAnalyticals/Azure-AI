**Speech to Text web page Project Example**

To implement the REST API solution that generates translation texts from audio provided via microphone on a website, you can use the Azure Speech-to-Text REST API. 
Here’s how you can implement it:
1.	Create a Speech resource: To use the Speech-to-Text REST API, you need to create a Speech resource in your Azure account. You can create a Speech resource using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell 1.
2.	Get an authentication token: To use the Speech-to-Text REST API, you need to obtain an authentication token. You can get an authentication token by sending a POST request to the token endpoint with your Speech resource’s subscription key and region 2.
3.	Send audio to the Speech-to-Text REST API: You can send audio to the Speech-to-Text REST API by sending a POST request to the Speech-to-Text REST API endpoint with the audio data in the request body. You can use the audio/wav content type for audio data 2.
4.	Receive the transcribed text: The Speech-to-Text REST API will return the transcribed text in the response body. You can parse the response body to extract the transcribed text 2.
JavaScript code that demonstrates how to use the Speech-to-Text REST API to transcribe audio from a microphone on a website:
In this example, the JavaScript code sends a POST request to the token endpoint to obtain an authentication token. It then starts recording audio from the microphone using the getUserMedia method. It stops recording audio and sends the recorded audio to the Speech-to-Text REST API using a POST request. The Speech-to-Text REST API returns the transcribed text in the response body, which is then saved to a file with a timestamp and the source and translated languages.


Here’s the HTML code for the buttons:
HTMLAI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
<button id="start-recording-button">Start Recording</button>
<button id="stop-recording-button" disabled>Stop Recording</button>
When the user clicks the “Start Recording” button, the JavaScript code starts recording audio from the microphone. When the user clicks the “Stop Recording” button, the JavaScript code stops recording audio and sends it to the Speech-to-Text REST API for transcription.

 
This JavaScript code is used to transcribe audio from a microphone using the Azure Speech-to-Text REST API. Here’s what the code does:
1.	The code sets the subscriptionKey and region variables to the subscription key and region of your Azure Speech resource.
2.	The code sends a POST request to the token endpoint to obtain an authentication token. The authentication token is used to authenticate the Speech-to-Text REST API requests.
3.	The code starts recording audio from the microphone using the getUserMedia method.
4.	When the user clicks the “Stop Recording” button, the code stops recording audio and sends it to the Speech-to-Text REST API for transcription.
5.	The Speech-to-Text REST API transcribes the audio data to text and returns the transcribed text in the response body of the POST request.
6.	The code parses the response body to extract the transcribed text and saves it to a file with a timestamp and the source and translated languages.
